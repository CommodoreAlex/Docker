# Getting Started with Docker

This guide is designed to give you a solid introduction to containerization and help you get Docker up and running on your system.

## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to:
- **Build, ship, and run applications** inside lightweight, portable containers.
- Simplify application deployment by bundling code, dependencies, and configuration into a single unit.
- Improve scalability, consistency, and resource utilization.

Docker is a powerful tool for modern software development and system administration.

## Benefits of Containerization
Containerization with Docker offers several advantages:
- **Portability:** Containers can run consistently across different environments (development, testing, production).
- **Efficiency:** Containers are lightweight and use fewer system resources compared to virtual machines.
- **Isolation:** Each container runs independently, improving security and reducing conflicts between applications.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale your applications horizontally by adding more containers.

## Installing Docker
Follow these step-by-step instructions to install Docker on your operating system:

### 1. Prerequisites
- A 64-bit operating system.
- Administrative privileges.
- An active internet connection.

### 2. Installation Steps
#### On Linux:
1. Update your package index:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install Docker using the package manager:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker.io
   ```
3. Start and enable Docker:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

#### On Windows:
1. Download Docker Desktop from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. After installation, restart your system and launch Docker Desktop.

#### On macOS:
1. Download Docker Desktop from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Drag and drop the Docker app to your Applications folder.
3. Launch Docker Desktop and complete the setup process.

### 3. Verify Installation
To confirm Docker is installed and running, open a terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
docker --version
```
You should see the installed version of Docker displayed.

### 4. Test Docker
Run the following command to test Docker with a "Hello, World!" container:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
This command pulls a test image from Docker Hub, runs it in a container, and prints a confirmation message.
